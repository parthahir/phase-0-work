# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control allows us to view the entire history of revisions to one or more files and merge revisions made by different people. This allows us to add save points to our work that we can return to when a problem arises.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of a project that can be edited independently of the default (master) branch and merged into the master branch at any point. This allows you to switch between work on multiple features of the project and develop additions without changing the original master branch until you're sure you want to merge them.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is like a save point that makes a note of what changes were made to your project and when. Good commit messages are concise and let you know exactly what features of your project were adjusted, when they were adjusted, and by whom they were adjusted.
* What is a merge conflict?
The error that occurs when merging two different branches with identical commits as Git doesn't know what information to keep and what to discard.
